# Vagrant Templates

This repository contains a bunch of vagrant templates with provisions. Each top level directory defines a single template and each has it's own documentation.

## How to use this repo

The easiest thing to do is to clone the repo, take the template you want and then use it for your project. Depending on the template, you may wish to keep the vagrant development environment (your version of the template) in a seperate directory to the project but that's up to you.

If you come up with any changes you think would be useful, then simply put them back into your fork and send me a pull request!

* [NodeJS, MySQL, Redis, and NGinx](./node)
